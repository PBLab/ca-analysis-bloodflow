# Calcium and Bloodflow Analysis

## By Hagai Har-Gil

A library with a variety of functions, scripts and examples that do (almost)
everything you'd like in the field of calcium signals and bloodflow analysis.

This package is very much always work in progress, so expect scripts -
definitely the older ones - to sometimes break. It also means that some
functionality here is redundant as it was replaced over the years with newer
and better replacements. Look at the more recently-edited scripts for an idea
of how to use some of the functions in this library.

## Documentation
